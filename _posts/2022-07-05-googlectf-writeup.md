2022 Google CTF writeup

***

## Cycling

|  Name  |  Category  |  Points  |  Solves  |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
|  Cycling  |  CRYPTO  |  201 / 500  |  50  |

### Description
> It is well known that any RSA encryption can be undone by just encrypting the ciphertext over and over again.
> 
> If the RSA modulus has been chosen badly then the number of encryptions necessary to undo an encryption is small.
> 
> However, if the modulus is well chosen then a cycle attack can take much longer. This property can be used for a timed release of a message.
> 
> We have confirmed that it takes a whopping 2^1025-3 encryptions to decrypt the flag.
> 
> Pack out your quantum computer and perform 2^1025-3 encryptions to solve this challenge. Good luck doing this in 48h.
